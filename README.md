# SmoothStore - how UX looks like with EIP-7702

SmoothStore is a chain agnostic decentralized application (dApp) designed to seamlessly onboard users to decentralized storage solutions. It allows users to store their files securely across various storage providers in the network while ensuring data privacy and user convenience. The core highlight of SmoothStore is the integration of **EIP-7702**, which revolutionizes user authentication in the Web3 space.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In the current Web3 ecosystem, storing data on decentralized platforms like Filecoin is inherently public, which poses challenges for users who prioritize privacy. SmoothStore addresses this by implementing **client-side encryption** using the user's wallet, ensuring that sensitive data never leaves the user's system in an unencrypted state.

To further enhance the user experience, SmoothStore integrates **Dynamic Wallet** functionality, allowing users to log in using familiar Web2 authentication methods like Google and GitHub. This bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3, reducing friction for users who are new to the decentralized world.

Additionally, a significant hurdle in Web3 is the complex user flow that involves multiple transaction signatures, wallet management, and the need for users to manually approve each transaction. SmoothStore simplifies this process by leveraging the innovative **EIP-7702**.

## üîë What is EIP-7702?

[EIP-7702](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-7702.md) introduces a game-changing method for user authentication and transaction signing in the Web3 ecosystem. This Ethereum Improvement Proposal enables the use of biometric data such as **FaceID, fingerprint**, or other device-based biometric authentication as private keys. This means users can authorize and batch multiple transactions using a single authentication step, effectively solving the UX friction that currently prevents broader adoption of Web3 applications.

### Key Advantages of EIP-7702:

- **Seamless User Experience**: Removes the need for repeated transaction approvals, reducing friction for users.
- **Enhanced Security**: Utilizes device-level biometric data, which is highly secure and already familiar to most users.
- **Efficient Onboarding**: Allows users to interact with the dApp in a manner similar to Web2 applications like Google Drive.

## üåü Key Features

1. **Client-Side Encryption**: Ensures that files are encrypted locally on the user's device before being uploaded, preserving privacy.
2. **Multi-Provider Storage Support**: SmoothStore connects with multiple decentralized storage providers, offering users flexibility and redundancy.
3. **Biometric Authentication via EIP-7702**: Batch transactions using FaceID or fingerprint, streamlining the user journey.
4. **Dynamic Wallet Integration**: Enables users to log in using Google, GitHub, and other OAuth providers, bridging Web2 and Web3 experiences.
5. **Google Drive-Like Interface**: Provides a familiar, intuitive UI for Web3 users, simplifying the transition from traditional cloud storage platforms.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **User Onboarding**:

   - Users can choose to log in via their Web3 wallet (Metamask, WalletConnect, etc.) or through a Dynamic Wallet using their Google/GitHub credentials.
   - Enable EIP-7702 for biometric authentication to streamline transaction approval.

2. **Data Upload**:

   - Select files to store.
   - Files are encrypted on your device using your wallet's private key.
   - Encrypted files are distributed among supported decentralized storage providers.

3. **Transaction Optimization**:
   - SmoothStore leverages EIP-7702 to batch all necessary transactions, so users only authenticate once using their biometrics.
   - The Dynamic Wallet ensures easy onboarding for users not familiar with Web3 wallets.
